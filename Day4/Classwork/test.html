<!--
 For this test code, I wanted to see how the grid would behave if I had a container using grid property inside a body with flex display property. 
 I wanted to see if the items would be placed in the columns or if they would be placed in the rows.
 I also wanted to see if the items would be placed in the center of the container.
 I also wanted to see if the container would be centered in the body.(This was the main part as it is part of task1)
